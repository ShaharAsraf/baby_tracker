📌 Full Project Prompt — “BabyCare Tracker” App

Project Goal:
Build a Flutter app named BabyCare Tracker that helps parents track multiple babies' feeding amounts, times, and diaper changes. The app must support shared accounts (e.g., both parents) so they can collaboratively add and view logs on separate devices. Offline usage must sync when internet returns.

🔐 Features
1️⃣ User Authentication

Firebase Authentication

Support login via Email & Password or Email Link

All babies & logs tied to authenticated user account

Allow multiple users in the same "family group" to share babies' data

2️⃣ Baby Profiles

Add, edit, remove babies

Fields:

Name (required)

Date of birth (required)

Photo (optional)

3️⃣ Feeding Tracking

Add feeding entry:

Amount (ml/oz)

Type: Bottle / Breast / Solid

Timestamp

Optional notes

Daily total summary per baby

History and charts

4️⃣ Feeding Interval Reminders

Per-baby interval (e.g. every 3 hours)

Local notification when feeding is due

Snooze option

Mark as completed directly from notification

5️⃣ Pee & Poop Tracking

Log diaper events:

Pee

Poop

Timestamp

Notes (optional)

Daily counts + trends

6️⃣ Analytics (basic dashboards)

Weekly chart of feeding amounts

Weekly diaper chart

🗃 Data + Sync Architecture

Use a hybrid architecture:

Component	Technology	Purpose
Local database	Drift (SQLite ORM)	Offline first
Cloud database	Firebase Firestore	Sync between parents
Auth	Firebase Auth	Shared access
Sync service	Background worker	Push/pull changes

All CRUD operations go through Bloc → Repository → Local DB → Cloud sync

Conflict resolution strategy: latest timestamp wins

🔔 Notifications System

flutter_local_notifications

Scheduled alarms based on feeding interval

Works offline

📱 UI / UX Requirements

Clean baby-friendly UI (pastel colors, soft edges)

Baby selector at top of screen

Large quick-action buttons:

Add Feeding

Add Pee/Poop

Timeline view for logs

Light/Dark mode supported

💡 Technical Requirements

State management: Bloc

Local persistence: Drift

Cloud sync: Firestore

Dependency injection recommended (e.g., get_it)

Modular architecture:

lib/
  data/
    models/
    repositories/
    local/
    remote/
  logic/ (Bloc folders)
  presentation/
    screens/
    widgets/


Unit tests for core logic + sync

Integration tests for add-feeding workflow

🔮 Stretch / Future Features

Export logs to PDF/CSV

Wear OS / Apple Watch companion

Growth charts (weight/height tracking)

Home-screen widgets

👉 Deliverables expected:

Fully working Flutter project

Firebase setup instructions

Support for iOS and Android

App icon and onboarding screens
